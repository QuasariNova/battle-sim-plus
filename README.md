Unofficial Update for FoW:Battle Sim

# Goals:
* Get all New Frontiers cards working with FOW: Battle Sim.
* Matchmaking update
* AI update

# Timeline
Right now the focus is getting the cards working. I'm trying to do a few cards a day, but some of the deeper edits requiring me to add to the unity script makes things take a lot longer. If and when the Battle Sim is made open source, I'll transition my changes to the actual source code. Also, matchmaking will probably not come until the original program goes open source. Changing the UI will be much easier at that point.

# Issues
Strange Miracle's untargetable feature doesn't work correctly. Since there are so few abilities/cards that actual target players, I don't deem it too important to fix since I've spent a few hours trying to debug why my new efficacy isn't working and I really only have one versus card to test it against>.<
